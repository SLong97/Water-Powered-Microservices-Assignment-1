# Water-Powered-Microservices-Assignment-1

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will analyse a requirement using some of the approaches covered so far, e.g.
bounded contexts, deciding how a system could be broken up into microservices as opposed to
being developed as something monolithic. You will then use Python and Docker, with gRPC and a
message queue, such as RabbitMQ, to communicated between microservices. In assignment 2, we
will use Kubernetes to orchestrate the system and add some additional testing and monitoring.

## Requirement

A new video game service is being launched and will eventually rival the Steam platform. The initial
system must allow new users to sign up using their email as the login. They can do the following:
* Browse a game catalogue
* Buy games for download
* Look at their game achievements / badges
* Earn points to spend on vouchers or other digital assets
* Manage their profile and preferences
* 2 or 3 other requirements you think would be useful (e.g. check Steam, Epic store, etc. for
ideas)

## Task

Implement a portion of the system that includes:
* The user registration web page
* A datastore for the users
* 2 or 3 other microservices of your choice (these should be simple, minimal version of
the microservices to keep your workload smaller)
